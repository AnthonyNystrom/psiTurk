# Overview


1. What is [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com) (AMT)?  

2. Who are the people in the system (demographics, etc...)?

3. How can it be used for behavioral research?

4. What are the mechanics of using the system?

5. Describe a [simple Python-based web-app](https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk) we developed which could be starting framework for your experiment

for behavioral researchers.

# Our three goals

1. Help you decide if it is right to use in your work

2. Share what we've learned in the process of collecting data with the system

3. Describe our system for helping you develop your own experiments

# What is ".blue[Mechanical Turk]"?


---

# The history

<img src="images/bezos.jpg" width="250" align="right"><br>


- Developed by [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com) by Peter Cohen

- Originally for in-house use to detect duplicate product postings on Amazon's site

- Jeff Bezos calls it "artificial artificial intelligence"

- Name originates from a mechanical chess illusion/automaton by Wolfgang von Kempelen in the 18th century

- Nice summary in the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/business/yourmoney/25Stream.html)

# The concept

<img src="images/crowdsource.png" alt="Crowdsourcing" width="300" align="left">
"Normally, a human makes a request of a computer, and the computer does the computation of the task, but artificial artificial intelligences like Mechanical Turk invert all that. The computer has a task that is easy for a human but extraordinarily hard for the computer. So instead of calling a computer service to perform the function, it calls a human.” 

### - Jeff Bezos

---

# What kinds of tasks?

- Difficult for computer
    - Provide three key words to describe a randomly selected image
    - Does this photograph contain a car?
    - Type the characters in this image (e.g., captcha)
    
- Regular "work"
    - Go to http://mycompany.com and email my some comments on what you think of the design

- Help with science!
    - Participate in my human cognition/perception/learning experiment!

---

# Key terminology

- **HIT** = Human Intelligence Task (a unit of work, e.g. a trial or an entire sequence of trials in an experiment)

- **Requester** = an entity (e.g., researcher) who posts HITS

- **Worker** = a person who performs the task

---

# Who are the workers?

- 46.80% US, 34% India, 19.20% Other

- United States demographic
    - 55-65% female
    - Most make <$60k/year
    - Median age of 30
    - Hold bachelor’s and are young
    - Distribution mostly similar to US internet pop.
    
- See Ipeirotis, et al. (2010) or Mason and Siddharth (2011).

# US Distribution

# World Distribution

# Compensation

- Median wage is $1.38/hour

- Short tasks (~5 mins) award around 10 cents

- Requester can reject work and revoke payment

- Can also **award bonuses**

- Amazon takes 10% of payments

- Amazon tries to stay out of disputes


---

# Why mess with this?

- **Convenient** - and our scripts help you even more

- **Fast** 
    - collect LOTS of data quickly
    - iterate designs daily if you want
    - collect large N studies
    - pilot study materials
    - gather norms
    - pretest stimuli
    
- **Affordable**
    - Relative to fMRI incredibly cost effective
    - We paid about $2.00 for 15-25 minute session

---

# Why stay away?

- **Quality assurance** Are people following instructions? Can they read them actually?

- **Attrition** the cost (social or otherwise) for closing the browser and quitting the experiment is low

- **Non-lab setting** You don’t have control over distractions.  _People could get up and leave for 1 hour in the middle of your experiment (needs lots of controls in your data to check for this)_

- **Undergrads = mturk population?**  Is this really a different population? 

---

# IRB Issues

- Some IRBs are more cautious than need be

- Since participants never meet experimenter and are free to close browser and walk away at any moment the IRB issues seem non-existent (should be exempt, but check with your local IRB)

- Main concern would be if materials/stimuli are controversial and might reflect poorly on the field, sponsors, or university

- Wasn't very difficult to add to an existing IRB at NYU
