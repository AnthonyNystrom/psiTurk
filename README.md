What is this?
------------

PsiTurk is an open framework for conducting custom behvioral experiments on
Amazon's Mechanical Turk. 

It is intended to provide most of the backend machinery necessary to run your
experiment. It uses AMT's _External Question_ HIT type, meaning that you can
collect data using any website. As long as you can turn your experiment into a
website, you can run it with PsiTurk!

Requirements
------------

You will need to use a relatively recent version of [Python 2](http://python.org) with the following
modules installed:

 * [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) --- A lightweight web framework.
 * [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) --- A powerful SQL abstraction layer.
